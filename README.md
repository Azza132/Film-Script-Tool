# FADE IN — Screenplay Writer
**Created by Aaron Sermon**

A browser-based screenplay writing tool built to help you write scripts in proper Hollywood format. No installation required — just open the HTML file in any modern web browser.

---

## Getting Started

1. Download `screenplay-writer.html`
2. Open it in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
3. Start writing in the white page area in the centre of the screen
4. Give your project a title by clicking the title field at the top and typing your screenplay's name

That's it. No sign-up, no installation, no internet required (except for the AI Assist feature — see below).

---

## The Interface

The app is split into three panels surrounding a central writing area.

**Left Sidebar** — Element buttons, scene index, and live stats  
**Centre** — The screenplay page where you write  
**Right Panel** — Character tracker, AI Assist, scene notes, and a quick reference guide

---

## Writing Your Script

Click anywhere on the white page and start typing. The editor uses Courier Prime, the standard screenplay font, at the correct size.

Screenplays follow a strict formatting convention. The main elements are:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Scene Heading** | Where and when a scene takes place. e.g. `INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT` |
| **Action** | What the camera sees. Present tense, visual only. |
| **Character** | The name of whoever is about to speak, in ALL CAPS. |
| **Dialogue** | What the character says. |
| **Parenthetical** | A brief acting direction inside brackets, e.g. `(quietly)` |
| **Transition** | A scene change instruction, e.g. `CUT TO:` or `DISSOLVE TO:` |
| **Shot** | A specific camera instruction, e.g. `CLOSE ON:` |

## Inserting Formatted Elements

Rather than typing formatting manually, use the element tools to insert pre-formatted blocks:

### Option 1 — Toolbar
Click any button in the toolbar at the top (Scene, Action, Character, Dialogue, etc.) to insert that element at your cursor position.

### Option 2 — Left Sidebar Buttons
The left sidebar has the same element buttons with keyboard shortcut hints displayed alongside them.

### Option 3 — Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Element |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl + 1` (or `Cmd + 1` on Mac) | Scene Heading |
| `Ctrl + 2` | Action |
| `Ctrl + 3` | Character |
| `Ctrl + 4` | Dialogue |
| `Ctrl + 5` | Parenthetical |
| `Ctrl + 6` | Transition |
| `Ctrl + 7` | Shot |

## Scene Index

As you write scene headings (lines beginning with `INT.` or `EXT.`), they will automatically appear in the scene list in the left sidebar. Click any scene in the list to jump to it in the editor.

---

## Character Tracker

In the right panel, you can maintain a list of your characters.

- Type a name in the input box and press **Enter** or click **+** to add them
- Characters are automatically converted to ALL CAPS
- Click a character's name to instantly insert their cue into the script at your cursor position
- Click the **✕** next to a name to remove them from the list

---

## Live Stats

The bottom of the left sidebar shows running stats for your screenplay:

- **Pages** — Estimated page count (based on ~180 words per page, roughly 1 minute of screen time)
- **Scenes** — Number of scene headings detected
- **Words** — Total word count
- **Characters** — Number of characters in your tracker

---

## AI Assist

> ⚠ This feature requires an active internet connection and API access. It will not work offline or as a standalone file without the appropriate setup.

The AI Assist panel lets you ask for help generating screenplay content. For example:

- *"Write a tense argument between two old friends"*
- *"Suggest a way to transition from a courtroom to a prison cell"*
- *"Write an opening scene set in 1940s New York"*

Type your request and click **Generate**. The AI will write formatted screenplay content based on your prompt and the recent context of your script. When the result appears, click **+ Insert Into Script** to add it directly at your cursor position.

Press `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter`) to generate without clicking the button.

---

## Scene Notes

The Scene Notes box in the right panel is a freeform notepad for your own reference — jot down ideas, character motivations, research notes, or reminders. These notes are not saved to your exported file.

---

## Exporting Your Script

Click the **Export** button in the top-right corner. Your screenplay will be saved as a plain text `.txt` file, named after your project title. This file can be opened in any text editor or word processor.

---

## Starting a New Script

Click the **New** button in the top-right corner. You will be asked to confirm before the current content is cleared.

---

## Format Guide

Click **Format Guide** in the top-right corner for a pop-up reference covering all screenplay elements and industry tips.

## Tips for Good Screenwriting

- Keep action blocks to four lines or fewer — white space aids readability and pacing
- Only write what can be seen or heard on screen — no internal thoughts unless voiced
- One page equals approximately one minute of screen time; a feature film is typically 90–120 pages
- Use parentheticals sparingly — let the dialogue speak for itself
- Transitions like `CUT TO:` are largely optional in modern scripts; overuse can feel dated
- Read produced screenplays to get a feel for professional style and pacing

---

## Compatibility

The app runs in any modern browser. No plugins or extensions are needed. All features except AI Assist work fully offline.
